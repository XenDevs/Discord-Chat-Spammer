# Discord Self-Bot Spammer
Original - https://github.com/kyan0045/Spammer

# Setup
``npm install``

Set the proper values in config-example.json and tokens-example.txt

Then run ``cp tokens-example.txt tokens.txt && cp config-example.json config.json`` (This is in place to prevent you from accidentally leaking your tokens & webhook)

Then set the messages you would like spammed in /data/messages.txt

Once you have setup everything you can run ``node .`` to start the self-bot.
